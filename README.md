# y-cruncher

y-cruncher is a program written by Alexander J. Yee. More information can be
found at numberworld.org. In this repository, I keep the validation files for
computations I have run. I may also put small portions of the digits or
properties computed from the digits (since uploading many GB/TB of digits is
infeasible and not appropriate for a git repository).

The machine I am currently using to compute digits is described below. Many of
the components were found recycled.
