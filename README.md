# y-cruncher

y-cruncher is a program written by Alexander J. Yee. More information can be
found at numberworld.org. In this repository, I keep the validation files for
computations I have run. I may also put small portions of the digits or
properties computed from the digits (since uploading many GB/TB of digits is
infeasible and not appropriate for a git repository).

The machine I am currently using to compute digits is described below. Many of
the components were found recycled.

- System board: Asus P6T Deluxe V2 (found recycled)
- CPU: i7-920 @ 2.67 GHz (4C / 8T) (found with system board)
- Memory: 6x 4 GiB triple channel PC3-12800U (DDR3-1600) running at 1066 MHz (taken
from a few recycled Dell Optiplex 7010 computers)
- GPU: NVidia GeForce 8400GS (found recycled)
- PSU: Corsair HX850 (borrowed from a PC I built years ago)
- Scratch space disks: 6x 250 GB SATA, various models found recycled, RAID0
- Output space disks: 2x 250GB IDE, both are recycled WD2500JB, OS + 2x 240GB
RAID0 volume
