# i3-4130T server

These validation files are intended to be more of a quick way to get an idea of
how long RAM-only computations take for many constants that are available to
compute with y-cruncher. The amount of RAM in the server varied for some
computations but it was always sufficient and in dual channel mode. The memory
type was always PC3-8500E (1066MHz) and for each computation, the server was
dedicaded specifically to run only that on a fresh Ubuntu Server 18.04 install.
