See sytem specification in the main README.md

Below is a list of computations performed on this machine:

Computation 1: "e - 20200120-235640.txt"
- e: 100B digits, ~23 hours (on 2020-01-20)
- This computation ran smoothly without interruption and finished sooner than I
was expecting.

Computation 2:
- e: 300B digits
- Started on 2020-01-21, completed on 2020-01-24
- Since the previous computation went smoothly, I decided to compute e again,
but to as much precision as disk space will allow. This also completed without
issues.

Computation 3:
- Golden Ratio: 25B digits, ~85 minutes (on 2020-06-10)
- This was run to test the new setup with 12 hard drives
